1. When designing the machine, you should adopt a "layered design" approach. Break down the user's requirements into the functions that the machine needs to achieve, and list the functional points.
2. For each functional point, design a structure that can meet the function. A structure can be understood as a "group of blocks," and several structures combined form the machine.
3. For each structure, determine the types of blocks to be used.
4. Determine the construction order of the structures to make the machine-building process layered. List which structure is the foundation and which is the upper-layer structure, and establish the construction sequence chain.
5.*Construction guide* : for each structure, provide a block-by-block construction guide. In natural language, describe how the current structure should be built, detailing step-by-step which block to place at what step and where it should go.
