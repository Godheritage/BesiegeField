**1. Task & Context**

*   **Task Objective:**
    *   [Insert task description here]
*   **Preceding Information (if any):**
    *   **Defect Report:**
        *   [Insert the defect analysis of the machine here]
    *   **Modification History:**
        *   [Insert previous modification records here, leave blank if none]
    *   **Environmental Feedback:**
        *   [Insert information on the movement of certain parts of the machine after it enters the environment]

**2. Machine Data**

The received machine data is composed of the following sections:

*   **A. Explanation of the 3D Information Structure**
    This is key to understanding the machine's state. The information structure for each block is as follows:
    *   `Name`, `Type ID`, `Order ID`: Basic identifiers for the block.
    *   `On Ground`: `True`/`False`, indicates if the block is touching the ground.
    *   `Relative Info`: Describes the block's **connection relationships**.
        *   `Parent Info`: Which parent block and "build point" the current block is attached to, along with its relative orientation.
        *   `Child Info`: Which child blocks are attached to this block.
    *   `Absolute Info`: Describes the block's state in the **world coordinate system**.
        *   `Center Point Coordinates`: The geometric center position of the block.
        *   `Orientation`: The block's global orientation (e.g., z+, z-, x+).
    *   `Special Attributes`: Unique properties of functional blocks, for example:
        *   `Propulsion Direction`: The direction of force provided by a wheel.
    Here are abbreviation of these properties in 3D info:
    *   Name -> n
    *   Type ID -> tid
    *   Order ID -> id
    *   Relative Information -> rel
    *   Parent Block Information -> parent
    *   Child Block Information -> children
    *   Absolute Information -> abs
    *   Center Point Coordinates -> center
    *   Build Point Coordinates -> buildPt
    *   Orientation -> orient
    *   Rotation -> rot
    *   Contact with Ground -> onGround
    *   Constructible Point -> cpt
    *   Relative Orientation -> relOrient
    *   Build Point ID -> bpid

*   **B. JSON Format Specification**
    ```json
    [
        {"id":"0","order_id":0,"parent":-1,"bp_id":-1},
        {"id":"Block Type ID","order_id":"Block Order ID","parent":"Parent Block Order ID","bp_id":"Constructible Point ID in Parent Block"},
        ...
    ]
    ```
    If it is a linear block (Type ID is 7 or 9, other blocks are not linear blocks), it will be:
    ```json
    {
        "id":"Block Type ID",
        "order_id":"Block Order ID",
        "parent_a":"Parent A Block Order ID",
        "bp_id_a":"Constructible Point ID in Parent A Block",
        "parent_b":"Parent B Block Order ID",
        "bp_id_b":"Constructible Point ID in Parent B Block"
    }
    ```

*   **C. Key Defective Blocks**
    *   Only the 3D information of blocks reported as defective is listed here for focused analysis.

**3. Output Requirement**

Based on all the information above, please analyze the problem and provide an optimal set of **modification operations**.
