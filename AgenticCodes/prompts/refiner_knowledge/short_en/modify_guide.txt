### **Machine Modification Guide**

Please follow the steps below to analyze and modify the machine structure.

**Step 1: Analyze & Plan**
1.  **Diagnose the Current Machine**: Analyze its power, balance, structure, and overall movement to identify design flaws or areas for optimization.
2.  **Devise a Modification Plan**: Based on your diagnosis, decide which blocks to **move, remove,** or **add**.
3.  **Evaluate Modification Impact**: When planning, you must consider the impact of your changes on:
    *   **Task Objective**: Will the modification help complete the task?
    *   **Structural Stability**: Will it cause overlaps? Is the center of gravity balanced?
    *   **Functionality**: Are power and transmission working correctly? Is the orientation of special blocks correct?
4.  **Briefly Describe Modifications**: Before generating commands, describe your modification plan in a sentence or two using natural language.

**Step 2: Execute Modification Operations**
Use the following three command formats for modifications. Output only the operation commands, with each command on a new line.

1.  **Add Block (Add)**
    *   Format: Non-Linear: Add [block type ID] to [order_id] in [building_point]
                Linear: Add [block type ID] to [order_id_a] in [building_point_a] to [order_id_b] in [building_point_b]
    *   Rules:
        *   Can only be added to original blocks. You cannot add new blocks onto other newly added blocks.
        *   Linear blocks require specifying two connection points.

2.  **Remove Block (Remove)**
    *   Format: Remove [order_id]
    *   Rules:
        *   Can only remove original blocks.
        *   Cannot remove a block that has child blocks.

3.  **Move Block (Move)**
    *   Move [order_id] to [new_parent_order_id] in [new_building_point]
    *   Rules:
        *   Moves the target block and all its child blocks as a single unit.
        *   The new parent's `order_id` must be smaller than the `order_id` of the block being moved.
        *   Linear blocks cannot be moved.
        *   The move must change the block's original position.

**Step 3: Request Environment Feedback**
To verify the effect of your modifications, request data for key components during the simulation using the format below.

*   **Request Format**:
    ```
    <Required Feedback>
    [
        {
            "order_id": int,
            "duration": [float, float],
            "properties": ["position", "rotation", "velocity", "length"]
        }
    ]
    </Required Feedback>
    ```
*   **Rules**:
    *   Total game time is 5 seconds, sampled every 0.2s. The `duration` must not exceed this range.
    *   `order_id` and `duration` are mandatory.
    *   The `length` property is only applicable to linear blocks.

### **Global Rules & Reference Info**

*   **Core Requirements**:
    *   You must modify the blocks mentioned in the design flaws.
    *   The `order_id` of all blocks must remain unchanged throughout the entire process.
    *   The brackets `[]` in commands must be kept.
*   **Coordinate System Reference**: All blocks initially face the Z+ direction.
    *   **Facing Z+**: Front(z+), Back(z-), Left(x-), Right(x+), Up(y+), Down(y-)
    *   **Facing Z-**: Front(z-), Back(z+), Left(x+), Right(x-), Up(y+), Down(y-)
    *   **Facing X+**: Front(x+), Back(x-), Left(z+), Right(z-), Up(y+), Down(y-)
    *   **Facing X-**: Front(x-), Back(x+), Left(z-), Right(z+), Up(y+), Down(y-)
    *   **Facing Y+**: Front(y+), Back(y-), Left(x-), Right(x+), Up(z-), Down(z+)
    *   **Facing Y-**: Front(y-), Back(y+), Left(x-), Right(x+), Up(z+), Down(z-)
