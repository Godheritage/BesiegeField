1. Please do not output any irrelevant information.
2. The ground will always correctly appear beneath the machine, making normal contact with the block that has the lowest y-axis coordinate.
3. All blocks are affected by gravity. If a block with a large self-weight is built on certain non-powered non-static blocks, the non-static blocks may rotate due to the gravitational force of the sub-blocks.
4. Similarly, the power generated by powered blocks also needs to counteract the gravitational force of the sub-blocks.
5. Please adhere to the output format and avoid adding any irrelevant information in the JSON.
