This is a concise list of the blocks you can use for this construction. Please read and follow the rules carefully.
I. Block Information Format
Each block's information follows the dict format. Attributes that a block does not have will not appear in the keys.
1. Characteristic Tags:
   a. Non-static: The block can actively generate force or movement.
   b. Non-stable: The connection between the block and its parent block is non-rigid, allowing for movement or rotation.
   c. Linear: The block is used to connect two existing points rather than being attached to a single point.
   If there are no tags, it is a regular static and stable block.
2. Constructible Points:
   The key is in the format of Point ID, coordinates (relative coordinates), orientation (relative orientation).
II. Key Special Rules
1. Powered Wheel Rule (applicable to all powered wheels): The direction of power provided by the wheel is not the same as its orientation.
   - Forward (Z+ direction): The wheel should face sideways (X+ or X-).
   - Left turn (power pushes towards X-): The wheel should face forward (Z+).
   - Right turn (power pushes towards X+): The wheel should face backward (Z-).
   - When the wheel faces up or down (Y+ or Y-), it does not provide power.
2. Linear Blocks (reinforcing Bar, rubber band):
   - They do not have their own connection points but connect two other blocks.
   - Reinforcing Bar: Used to reinforce static structures with no collision volume.
   - Rubber band: Generates a contracting pull force along the line connecting its two ends when stretched.
3. Non-connecting Blocks (bombs, boulders):
   - These blocks are placed at the specified location but do not form a physical connection with any other block. Containers are usually needed to hold them.
