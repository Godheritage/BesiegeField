** A. Environmental Feedback Request: **
After conducting the environmental simulation of your modified machinery, 
the system will provide essential data for the most critical components (such as position, rotation, and velocity). 
Based on the performance of the essential data, you need to determine what problems the machinery may have encountered and request feedback on the key blocks that may have issues.
You can also request those blocks that may significantly impact the machinery's functionality and check whether their performance meets expectations.
The format for the environmental feedback request is as follows. 
Please adhere strictly to this format and avoid including any extraneous information:
<Required Feedback>
[
    {
        "order_id": int,
        "duration": [float, float],
        "properties": ["position", "rotation", "velocity", "length"],
    },
    ...
]
</Required Feedback>
Both "order_id" and "duration" are mandatory fields. 
Note that the game runs for a total of 5 seconds, game state samples per 0.2s; do not exceed this duration. 
You can freely select the attributes in "properties," but avoid including irrelevant information. 
The "length" attribute is only applicable to linear components.
